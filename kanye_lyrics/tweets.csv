476,2017-05-30 01:49:28+00:00,Its sad nobody ever knows how much someone is actually hurting... Someone right next to you could be completely broken and you wouldn't know
477,2017-05-30 01:48:22+00:00,"if they hurt you, why are you still thinking about them? "
478,2017-05-29 00:40:44+00:00,have you ever been in one of those moods where you don't really know whats wrong but you feel really irritated with everyone and everything
